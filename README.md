# test-ib
A PHP imageboard designed to be as simple to understand and maintain as possible.

Designed with the intention that any javascript provided is user opt-in only - the imageboard should be fully functional without it.

A MySQL database of the schema "/sql/Database.sql" is required, as is imagemagick support on the server.
